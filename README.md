Control Questions  

1. How is an array declared?  
Answer: An array is declared in the format "type name[size]".  

2. What types of arrays are possible?  
Answer: Integer, floating-point, character, logical, as well as user-defined types (structures, classes, pointers). Arrays can be one-dimensional or multidimensional.  

3. What happens if fewer elements are specified during initialization than the array size?  
Answer: The specified elements will be stored, and the remaining ones will be automatically filled with zeros (for basic types).  

4. What are the ways to access an array element?  
Answer: By index or through a pointer.  

5. How can one array be copied into another?  
Answer: By using a loop, standard functions, or containers.  

6. How is an array of pointers described?  
Answer: The array is declared so that each of its elements is a pointer to a certain type.  

7. What is dereferencing used for?  
Answer: To access the value stored at the memory address a pointer refers to.  

8. How is input and output of arrays performed?  
Answer: Using loops together with input/output operators.  

9. Name the known format specifiers.  
Answer: The main format specifiers are setw, setfill, left, right, fixed, scientific, setprecision, hex, oct, dec.
