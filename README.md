Control questions

How is an array declared?
Answer: type name[size]; (example: int a[10];).

What types of arrays are possible?
Answer: Any types â€“ integers, floating-point, char, bool, structures, classes, pointers; one-dimensional and multidimensional.

What happens if fewer elements are specified during initialization?
Answer: Specified values are stored, the rest are filled with zeros (for basic types).

How to access an array element?
Answer: By index a[i]; or through a pointer *(p+i).

How to copy one array into another?
Answer: With a loop, std::copy(), or assignment operator for std::vector.

How to describe an array of pointers?
Answer: type *name[size]; (example: int *p[5];).

What is dereferencing for?
Answer: To get the value stored at the address a pointer refers to (*p).

How to input and output arrays?
Answer: With a loop using cin >> a[i]; / cout << a[i];, or with iterators.

What are the known format specifiers (C++ iostream)?
Answer: fixed, scientific, setprecision, setw, setfill, left, right, hex, oct, dec, showpos.
